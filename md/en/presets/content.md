A preset is part of the session configuration. It applies to the task tabs the session owns, including tabs it opens later.

| Mode      | Network                                   | Environment                                 | Use                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `anti-ad` | Bundled filter lists                      | Optional, off by default                    | Ordinary task pages                               |
| `zen`     | `anti-ad` plus resource type restrictions | Optional, skipped when `zen` blocks scripts | Static or archive pages, bulk reading             |
| `none`    | No preset interception                    | Off                                         | Pages a preset breaks, or a run without filtering |

<Tabs items={["anti-ad", "none"]}>
  <Tab value="anti-ad">
    <Demo
      name="presets"
      still
      alt="A news front page in a task tab with the anti-ad preset: the stories fill the page and the ad slots are gone."
    />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="none">
    <Demo
      name="presets-none"
      still
      alt="The same news front page with the preset set to none: a leaderboard, a sidebar box and an in-feed box show ads."
    />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set a preset [#set-a-preset]

```js
const browser = await connect("archive");

await browser.preset("anti-ad", { environment: true });
await browser.navigate("https://example.com");

const status = await browser.call("preset", { cmd: "status" });
console.log(status);
```

`preset` stores the configuration for the session and applies it to the tabs the session owns. `navigate` accepts the same `preset`, `zen` and `environment` fields. It stores them once the navigation starts. From the command line:

```sh
omw call archive preset '{"preset":"zen","zen":{"images":true,"fonts":true,"css":false,"javascript":false}}'
omw call archive preset '{"cmd":"status"}'
```

A session that has not selected a preset uses `anti-ad`, the default for new task tabs.

## anti-ad [#anti-ad]

The lists are compiled into the extension at build time. `pnpm run filters:update` downloads them and records the URL, SHA-256 value, date and original notices in `third_party/filters/sources.lock.json`. The extension does not fetch rules or updates from a third-party server, and it works offline.

Included lists:

- AdGuard Base, with the EasyList duplicates removed, and AdGuard Tracking Protection
- EasyList and EasyPrivacy
- The enabled, non-regional default lists of uBlock Origin: filters, badware, privacy, unbreak, quick fixes, URLHaus and Peter Lowe

Regional lists and annoyance lists are not included. Packaged uBO scriptlets and redirect resources come from Ghostery's pinned copy.

The engine implements request blocking and exceptions. Redirects, response body and HTML rewriting, CSP directives and procedural cosmetics are not implemented. A page can therefore render differently than it does under uBlock Origin or AdGuard with the same lists.

## zen [#zen]

`zen` adds resource type blocking to `anti-ad`. Each switch is a boolean, and `true` blocks that resource type.

| Switch       | Blocks                       | Default |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `images`     | Image and image set requests | `true`  |
| `fonts`      | Font requests                | `true`  |
| `css`        | Stylesheet requests          | `false` |
| `javascript` | Script requests              | `false` |

`javascript: true` also stops inline scripts and event handler attributes. In Chrome, script execution is disabled through CDP. In Firefox, the extension adds `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'none'` to the document and iframe responses of the tab. `<noscript>` content then does not render, because the browser still reports scripting as enabled.

The restrictions cover network requests. Inline and data images, inline CSS and installed service worker caches are not affected. A site that needs stylesheets or scripts breaks under these switches. Select `none` or relax a switch and navigate again.

## environment [#environment]

`environment: true` adds cosmetics and scriptlets from the bundled lists, guarded by the document hostname. It is off by default, and skipped in `zen` while `javascript` is on.

Registration happens before the target document loads, so the setting applies to the next document the tab shows. It does not alter a page that is already loaded. Navigate again. A cross-host redirect or an iframe from another host receives network filtering only, because the guard never injects a different host's rules.

Environment injection is not anti-bot fingerprint spoofing. A scriptlet that fails to parse or throws affects only itself. Status reports installation, not successful execution of every scriptlet. In Firefox, `environment: true` is accepted but reported as `environmentState: "unavailable"`, and network filtering continues.

## none [#none]

`none` removes interception from task tabs. A raw CDP Fetch handler installed through `cdp` conflicts with a preset request handler on the same tab. Select `none` first.

## Borrowed tabs [#borrowed-tabs]

Presets apply only to tabs the session owns. A borrowed tab is never filtered, and it keeps no preset state for the session that borrowed it. Preset options on a navigation that targets a borrowed tab return `borrowed_tab`.

## Status [#status]

`preset {cmd:"status"}` reads the current tab and returns:

- the configuration: `name`, `environment`, `images`, `fonts`, `css`, `javascript`
- `blocked` and `allowed` request counts since the preset was installed
- `network`, whether interception is active on the tab
- `environmentState`: `off`, `active` or `unavailable`
- `fallback`, up to 8 reasons, each cut to 300 characters

Any other `cmd` value returns `invalid_args`. A configuration call returns `config`, a status entry for each task tab, `appliesOn` and `borrowedTabsExcluded`. `appliesOn` is `immediate; environment on next navigation` in Chrome.

## Costs and limits [#costs-and-limits]

- Matching runs in the extension background, in one filter engine shared by every tab. Requests are not sent to the daemon.
- Engine data is released 30 seconds after the last filtered tab stops filtering. The next preset loads it again.
- Network and script restrictions apply to existing task tabs and frames immediately. Environment registration applies to the next document.
- Reconfiguring a tab disables interception on every target of the tab first, so page requests continue while a busy frame delays the rest. Installing the new preset needs the current document to answer. Use `close_session` to recover an unresponsive page.
- Navigating a task tab whose preset did not change keeps the interception and sends no reconfiguration commands. With `environment` off, status counters continue across the navigation.
- If the lists fail to load, requests pass unfiltered and status keeps the reason. `zen` type blocking still applies.
- Chrome intercepts at most 128 targets per tab. Additional frames fail open and status records the reason. Firefox has no per-tab target limit.
- When Chrome restarts the extension worker, status reports `none` for existing tabs until a controlled navigation reapplies the stored session configuration. No site action is retried.
- `pnpm run filters:update` downloads the upstream lists, updates the gzip files and `sources.lock.json`, and fails on a download error or an invalid response. The build fails on an integrity mismatch between a list and its recorded SHA-256.

## Firefox [#firefox]

The Firefox build uses the same modes, lists and session settings. Network filtering runs in blocking `webRequest` listeners, environment injection is unavailable, and a blocked top-level page keeps the tab on its current page. [Firefox](https://oh-my-webbridge.github.io/en/firefox/#presets) covers the differences.
