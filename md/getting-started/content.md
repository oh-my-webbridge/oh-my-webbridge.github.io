# Getting started (https://oh-my-webbridge.github.io/getting-started/)

Chrome and Firefox can run side by side, and each browser is paired on its own.

## Requirements [#requirements]

- Chrome 156 or later, or Firefox 153 or later.
- macOS or Linux, on the same computer as the browser.
- `zstd` to unpack a release archive.
- Go 1.27.3, Node 24 and pnpm 11 to build from source.

## Install the daemon [#install-the-daemon]

<Tabs items={["Release archive", "Build from source"]}>
<Tab value="Release archive">

Download `omw-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.zst` for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/oh-my-webbridge/oh-my-webbridge/releases) and check it against the `SHA256SUMS` file from the same release. Unpack it:

```sh
zstd -dc omw-<version>-darwin-arm64.tar.zst | tar -xf - -C "$HOME/.local"
```

The archive holds `bin/omw`, `README.md` and the license files. Keep the binary on your `PATH`; the login service records that path.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Build from source">

Build from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
go build -trimpath -ldflags='-s -w' -o dist/omw ./cmd/omw
```

`pnpm run build` writes the Chrome extension to `dist/extension`, the Firefox extension to `dist/extension-firefox` and the SDK to `dist/sdk.mjs`.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Install the extension [#install-the-extension]

<Tabs items={["Chrome", "Firefox"]}>
<Tab value="Chrome">

Unpack `omw-<version>-chrome-mv3.tar.zst` into a folder. Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, choose **Load unpacked** and select that folder; the manifest sits at the archive root. A source build loads `dist/extension` the same way.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Firefox">

Unpack `omw-<version>-firefox-mv3.tar.zst`. Open `about:debugging`, choose **This Firefox** and **Load Temporary Add-on…**, then pick `manifest.json` in the unpacked folder. Firefox drops temporary extensions when it restarts. A permanent install needs a signature from addons.mozilla.org in self-distribution mode; submit `omw-<version>-firefox-mv3-unsigned.xpi` there. A source build loads `dist/extension-firefox`.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set up the browser [#set-up-the-browser]

Installing the extension opens the setup page. The popup reopens it with **Open setup** when the browser is not paired, the daemon is not running, or the daemon refuses the connection.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Start the daemon [#start-the-daemon]

Run `omw start`. It starts the daemon in the background and prints `started`, or `already running` when one is up. The step completes by itself once the page reaches the daemon; until then it reads "Waiting for the daemon on 127.0.0.1:17373".

</Step>
<Step>
### Pair this browser [#pair-this-browser]

Run `omw pair`. It prints a six-digit code such as `482 913`, valid for 5 minutes and 5 attempts. Type the code into the pairing code field. The extension saves the daemon token and shows "Paired".

</Step>
<Step>
### Try it with an agent [#try-it-with-an-agent]

Install the agent skill with `omw install-skill ~/.agents/skills`, then ask the agent for a browser task, for example to read the active tab.

</Step>
</Steps>

Firefox adds a step of its own before the last one, **Allow scripts**, whose button carries the same label. The `evaluate` action needs the optional user script permission; you can grant it there, or later under **Settings**, then **Pages**.

## Start at login [#start-at-login]

Move the binary to the path you intend to keep, then run:

```sh
omw service install
```

On macOS the command writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/app.oh-my-webbridge.plist` and loads it with `launchctl`. On Linux it writes `~/.config/systemd/user/oh-my-webbridge.service` and enables the unit with `systemctl --user`. The unit runs `omw serve` with the configuration directory used by the install command. Stop a daemon that `omw start` launched before installing the service, because the service starts its own. Stop the service through its manager:

```sh
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/app.oh-my-webbridge
```

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now oh-my-webbridge.service
```

`omw stop` asks a running daemon to exit and leaves tabs open. With the service installed, use the service manager so the daemon does not start again.

## Install the agent skill [#install-the-agent-skill]

`omw install-skill DIR` writes `DIR/oh-my-webbridge/SKILL.md` and copies the guide built into the binary. It refuses to overwrite an existing file, so delete the old one before installing again. `omw skill` prints the same guide. The guide tells an agent which commands to run, how sessions and tab ownership work, and which errors to expect.

## First commands [#first-commands]

```sh
omw call research navigate '{"url":"https://example.com","group_title":"Research"}'
omw call research snapshot
omw call research evaluate '{"code":"document.title"}'
omw call research close_session
```

The first argument after `omw call` is the session name; keep one name per task. Each command prints JSON on stdout.

- `navigate` opens a background tab in a new group titled `Research` and returns the tab id. Later navigations in the same session reuse that tab; pass `newTab` to open another.
- `snapshot` returns the accessibility tree with `@e` references that `click` and `fill` accept.
- `evaluate` returns the value of the expression.
- `close_session` closes the tabs the session owns and releases any borrowed tab.

The third argument is a JSON object. Pass `-` to read it from stdin, which avoids shell quoting:

```sh
omw call research evaluate - < request.json
```

When both browsers are connected, name one right after `omw call`:

```sh
omw call --browser firefox research snapshot
```

## Check the connection [#check-the-connection]

`omw doctor` prints the config path on stderr and the status JSON on stdout, then one line per browser on stderr:

```text
chrome: connected (VERSION)
firefox: not connected
```

`omw status` prints the same status JSON and browser lines without the config path. Both exit nonzero when the daemon does not answer.

<Callout type="warn" title="The token is the browser credential">

`omw connection` prints the daemon endpoint and token. Anyone who has the token can drive both paired browsers, so keep it out of logs and chat. To pair without the six-digit code, paste the 64 hex characters under **Settings**, then **Advanced**, then **Token**.

</Callout>
